#Rule for Quotes:-

In Python, we can write String Data either in single quotes or in
double quotes. Both are same.

But, the only rule is, If starting we are using single quotes then, at
Ending also we should use single quotes and

If starting we are using double quotes then, at
Ending also we should use double quotes.
